// Conditionals Industry.  Im creating a script to be used by a client that will tell me what kind of website they need designed, and how much money it will cost them.  The user will be able to tell me if they want it responsive, if they need a CMS, how many pages they need, and what their budget is.  The print outs will tell them if they have enough money, or if they need more.  It will also tell them what they can get for the budget they entered.
